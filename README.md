scdb
====

<abbr title="Subversion Configuration DataBase">SCDB</abbr> is a legacy <abbr title="Configuration Management DataBase">CMDB</abbr> for Quattor.
It is a complete and entirely compatible replacement for CERN's original CVS based CDB.
It is still supported, but not actively developed. <abbr title="Subversion Configuration DataBase">SCDB</abbr> suffers from scaling problems above 2500 hosts.

quattor/aquilon is recommended for new deployments.

See https://trac.lal.in2p3.fr/Quattor/wiki/Doc/SCDB for more information.
