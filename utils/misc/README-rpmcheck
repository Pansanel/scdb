This software is intended to check that the rpm list in a generated
LLD file is complete.  The script does this by extracting the full
list of rpms and then doing a fake install of those rpms.  Any
warnings or errors are written to stderr.  

The typical processing goes like:

./rpmcheck.pl --saxon=saxon7.jar \
              /var/lib/cdb/lld/xml/profile_localhost.xml

If any errors occur, then the list is not valid.  The rpm errors are
usually explicit enough to determine where the problem lies. 

NOTE: The transformation uses features from XSLT 2.0.  Saxon
implements this and was used for testing.  The Saxon code (v7+) can be
obtained from: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/.
